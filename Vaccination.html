			</center>
						<hr>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">India began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 16 January 2021. As of 30 November 2021, India has administered over 1.24 billion doses overall, including first and second doses of the currently-approved vaccines. Over 80% of the population of India have a positive response for getting anti covid shots. India has one of the lowest vaccine hesitancy in the world. There was vaccine hesitancy in the initial months of 2021, especially in rural India and among poor and tribal populations. Constant government and public awareness drastically reduced vaccine hesitancy. Since May 2021, more than half of daily doses administered in India have been from rural parts. Vaccine places in India have witnessed large number of people willing to get covid vaccine resulting in overcrowding and mismanagement. Many places across India in months of April & May reported severe shortage of covid vaccines due to large crowds turning up for vaccination. In cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru many people even after waiting for hours did not receive their covid vaccine due to shortage. Since July, vaccine supply has drastically increased thus India is vaccinating at a very fast pace.

			 <p style="font-size: 20px">
			 	One study published on vaccine acceptance shows that 79.5% of people from Delhi, a union territory in Northern India, want to take a COVID-19 vaccine. In another study which was published from West Bengal, a state in Eastern India, has shown that 77.27% of people want to take the COVID-19 vaccine. According to the finding from these two studies, it can be expected that over 75% of people want to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

			 <p style="font-size: 20px">
			 	India initially approved the Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca vaccine (manufactured under license by Serum Institute of India under the trade name Covid shield) and Covaxin (a vaccine developed locally by Bharat Biotech). They have since been joined by the Sputnik V (manufactured under license by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, with additional production from Serum Institute of India being started in September), Moderna vaccines, Johnson & Johnson vaccine and ZyCoV-D (a vaccine locally developed by Zydus Cadila)  and other vaccine candidates undergoing local clinical trials.
